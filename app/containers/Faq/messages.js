My strategy with life has been to explore all the wonders of our world from a Breadth First Search approach, and gradually hone in deep in the things where my strengths and mission align. I have found through this experience that I am most useful sitting at the intersection of technology, business, and politics. Yes, I care about politics, as any good citizen of the world ought to.'

      defaultMessage: 'It seems to me that while the world is faced with a series of existential threats, a lot of smart people with access to capital prefer to work at Snapchat. I have nothing against Snapchat specifically, but I think it\'s a good example for the point I want to make. We agree that intelligence and capital are a finite resource at any finite time period. It would make sense then, for those scarce resources to be directed at solving the world\'s most pressing problems, rather than sending disappearing nudes, no?'
